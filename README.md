# School_District_Analysis

# Purpose of this analysis
The purpose of this project is to perform an overall analysis of the mathematics and reading scores based on the school size, type of school and the school budget per student, compare the results and provide results for each school's performance.
Due to academic dishonesty, the mathematics and reading scores of ninth graders at Thomas High School were replaced by NaN, and a new analysis was performed.

# Summmary
  It is not possible to determine the dishonesty in the scores with the data we have. However, omitting Thomas High School's ninth graders math and reading scores resulted in changes in the new analysis. Although, it did not affect the perfomance based on te school size, it slightly impacted the scores by school type, which resulted in a 0.04% decrease. The Thomas High School's ninth graders scores were replaced by NaN and the overall passing percentage dropped.
